	AutoDJ is a program to play MP3 files. It remembers which files users
	played in what order and how often and saves this information to a MySQL
	database. Because of this the database not only stores the available
	MP3 files, but also in which combinations they can be played. You could
	call this a "dynamic playlist".
	
	Later it uses this information to automatically determine which file to
	play after the current file without any user interference. Given enough
	information it behaves like a DJ, hence the name.
	
	AutoDJ is written in Java and depends on a MySQL database it can reach
	somewhere over a network. It uses the jaudiotagger library for
	extracting ID3-tags from MP3 files. jaudiotagger is released under the
	LGPL and can be downloaded from http://www.jthink.net/jaudiotagger/.
